    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken sandwich appears already in the first part of the virtual
      adventures of Geralt of Rivia, and it makes a serious comeback in Witcher
      3: The Wild Hunt, where it’s a quite common consumable - you can buy it at
      the innkeeper or find in boxes or .... loot it from fallen enemies. This
      snack slowly restores health in case of no other options. In addition, we
      can also find the version with roasted chicken. Because it appears almost
      everywhere during our journey, the sandwich has become one of the most
      famous food item from the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      As famous and useful item during the game, this dish requires a proper
      treatment. It is impossible to imagine the Witcher’s universe without a
      lot of liquors - there are several types of alcohol in the game, so we
      will use Kaedweni Stout with a strong smoky aroma for a chicken marinade.
      We will also add grilled mushrooms and sauce with chopped parsley to
      finally close everything in rustic slices of sourdough bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a sandwich makes an ideal regeneration snack for keeping the vital
      strength during long hours of fierce gameplay!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>chicken breast - 350g</li>
      <li>mushrooms - 100g</li>
      <li>rye bread - 4 slices</li>
      <li>rapeseed oil - 1 tablespoon</li>
      <li>salt, pepper</li>
      <br />
      <li>mayonnaise - 3 tablespoons</li>
      <li>parsley - handful</li>
      <li>lemon juice - 1 tablespoon</li>
      <br />
      <li>dark beer, stout type - 200 ml</li>
      <li>garlic - 2 cloves</li>
      <li>spicy mustard - 1 tablespoon</li>
      <li>honey - 1-2 teaspoons</li>
      <li>lemon juice from half a lemon</li>
      <li>sweet paprika powder - ½ teaspoon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>marinade</h3>
        <p>
          Put the ingredients for the marinade into the saucepan (press garlic
          through the press) and mix thoroughly to combine. As for the choice of
          beer, it may be a stout, but also a sweet dark beer - then you have to
          try marinade before adding honey, so that it does not come out too
          sweet. Put the marinade on a very strong fire and cook to reduce the
          excess water - a sauce must have a density similar to the roast sauce.
          It should take about 15-20 minutes. Cool the ready marinade to room
          temperature and after that, coat cleaned chicken breasts with the
          marinade and put in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>sauce</h3>
        <p>
          Combine together mayonnaise, lemon juice, finely chopped parsley and a
          pinch of pepper and salt. Put the sauce in the fridge.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>grilling the meat</h3>
        <p>
          Frying pan version: Place the marinated meat on a hot, greased pan
          (preferably grill pan). Fry the fillets for about 4 minutes on medium
          heat, then turn them on the other side and fry for another 5 minutes.
          Additionally, fry each side for 30 seconds, gently holding the meat
          with tongs. At the end of frying, add a few tablespoons of water (it
          will sizzle and smoke) and shake the pan. Then cover it with a lid,
          reduce the gas to a minimum, stew for 1 min and turn off the burner.
          Pull the chicken out and transfer it to the plate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barbecue version: In the case of a traditional outdoor barbecue, the
          meat should be prepared with usage of trays. Grill marinated fillets
          for approx. 15 minutes, occasionally turning them over and spreading
          the remains of the marinade. When meat is properly browned, put it on
          the side of the grate (so that it's not directly above the burning
          coal) and leave for about 1-2 min of rest. Then transfer it on the
          plate.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>grilling of mushrooms and bread</h3>
        <p>
          On the same pan or grill, quickly grill the mushrooms, cut into thick
          slices (about 1 minute on each side), and finally sprinkle them
          lightly with salt and coarsely ground pepper. Remove the mushrooms
          from the pan / grill and toast the slices of bread, also about 1
          minute on each side.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>serving</h3>
        <p>
          Spread sauce on a slice of toasted bread, add grilled mushrooms and
          chicken breast, put on a second slice and also spread with sauce.
          Lightly press the sandwich with your hand (to make it more convenient
          to eat) and celebrate the Witcher meal!
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
