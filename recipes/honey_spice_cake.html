    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Holidays are coming so if you want to smuggle some Witcher-style food into
      your table, it's high time to make a dough for a maturing honey spice cake
      from the Ra’mses Gor-thon recipe!
    </p>
    <p>
      The recipe for long-maturing gingerbread appears in Blood and Wine DLC
      during the Spoontaneous Profits! mission. When we reach the legendary
      cooking studio of famous Toussaintois cook Ra’mses Gor-Thon underneath the
      Danamebi Temple Ruins, we find a treasure that contains three recipes for
      exquisite dishes, including a honey spice cake. The recipe is similar to
      the traditional recipe for Old-Polish gingerbread, although it indicates
      only a few days of maturing during which the dough must lay in a cold
      place. However, we will stick to the advice of Master Mirror regarding the
      production of this delicious cake from the Heart of Stone DLC and we will
      mature the cake for at least two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Polish version of in-game recipe Old-Polish measures were given,
      such as a quart (in the English version of the game we are given the
      division into cups) - we translated them into common units and divided
      them into three. Thus, the given ingredients are enough for one, long
      gingerbread. Of course, if you want, you make the bigger portion as it is
      given in the recipe. The dough is a bit more wet than traditional
      gingerbread, but the final result is amazing. Your Holidays table should
      definitely feature this honey spice cake!
    </p>

            spelt flour - 4/3 cup (means 1 & 1/3 cup) [OR SUBSTITUTE:
            all-purpose wheat flour (2/3 cup) + wholemeal wheat flour (2/3 cup)

          <li>pinch of salt</li>
          <li>[optional] baking soda - 1 tsp</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        zerrikanian spices blend
        <ul>
          <li>cinnamon, powdered – 2 tsp</li>
          <li>ginger, powdered – 1 tsp</li>
          <li>cloves, powdered – 1/2 tsp</li>
          <li>nutmeg, powdered – 1/2 tsp</li>
          <li>coriander, powdered – 1/2 tsp</li>
          <li>black pepper, ground – pinch</li>
          <li>cardamom, powdered - pinch</li>
          <li>all spice, powdered - pinch</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        for serving:
        <ul>
          <li>plum marmelade - 200g</li>
          <li>powdered sugar - 40g</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Stage 1</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the milk, honey and butter in a pot over a low flame - bring to a
        boil.
      </li>
      <li>Take the mixture off the heat and let cool until lukewarm.</li>
      <li>
        Add flour, egg, a mixture of zerrikan spices, a pinch of salt and baking
        soda.
      </li>
      <li>Mix everything vigorously until light and very sticky.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the mass into a clay pot or metal bowl, cover with a cloth and
        leave it in a cold place - to the basement or fridge for at least 2
        weeks. The longer the dough is matured, the better.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Your dough should mature and acquire the proper taste during at least 2-3
      weeks. So it's time to bake them!
    </p>

    <h3>Stage 2</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Before baking, take dough from the cellar or fridge and leave in a warm
        place.
      </li>
      <li>Mix and place the dough on baking paper lined with baking tray.</li>
      <li>Spread dough to a thickness of approx. 1 cm on a one big tray.</li>
      <li>
        Put the dough into the oven preheated to 170°C/325°F (top and bottom
        option) on 1/3 of the height.
      </li>
      <li>Gingerbread should bake about 15-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Control the color of the gingerbread during baking - a cake with the
        addition of honey may be quickly burned.
      </li>
      <li>Take out the baked gingerbread of the oven and cool it down.</li>
      <li>Level the gingerbread edges by cutting them off with a knife.</li>
      <li>Divide the cake into three equal parts.</li>
      <li>Carefully remove them from the mold.</li>
      <li>Spread plum jam on two of the parts of the cake.</li>
      <li>
        Put one part with a jam on another one and cover with the third, plain
        one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the gingerbread with paper and weight it with a large, wooden
        board on top.
      </li>
      <li>Leave the cake for a day in a cool place to let flavours blend.</li>
    </ol>
