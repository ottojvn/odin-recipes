    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      What do witchers eat? Probably you asked yourself this question more than
      once … in turn, we would rather ask if witchers, except skills useful in
      their profession, also have a culinary talent?
    </p>
    <p>
      It might seem that after passing the mutations trial, qualified monster
      killers are not really familiar with culinary pleasures. Nothing could be
      more wrong! In books, Geralt often has an occasion to taste local
      specialties, from both simple and more exquisite cuisine. White wolf,
      together with his travel companions, enjoyed dishes served in roadside
      taverns as well as in the most wonderful inns or royal banquets. Well, but
      do witchers know how to cook something by themselves? In the books of
      Andrzej Sapkowski the subject of kitchen arts wasn’t pushed into the
      background by other plots. In addition to the diverse characteristics of
      the dishes assigned to specific regions and places in the universe, the
      author even attempted to distinguish some characters by determining their
      culinary skills. And thanks to that we know what witchers ate in Kaer
      Morhen and that even one of the them, Lambert, was given a very special
      distinction… a total lack of culinary talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the life of every witcher, duties often outweigh the pleasures.
      However, in this case we mean the management of responsibilities in the
      kitchen of witchers’ settlement. We still believe that few lessons will be
      enough to help Lambert increase his cooking skills! Let it be the first
      one :) The recipe is based on a traditional, Polish dumplings made of
      grated, raw potatoes (called “grey dumplings”) and few additional
      ingredients which fit the surrounding, mountain terrain of Kaer Morhen.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>
        dumplings
        <ul>

          <li>egg - 1 small</li>
          <li>all purpose flour - 1/2 cup, plus more if needed</li>
          <li>potato starch - 1 tbsp</li>
          <li>salt - 1/2 tsp</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        toppings
        <ul>
          <li>onion - 1 small</li>
          <li>forest mushrooms, dried (such as bay boletus) - 15 g</li>
          <li>bear’s garlic, dried - 1 tsp</li>
          <li>butter - 1 tbsp</li>
          <li>freshly ground pepper</li>
          <li>salts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>mushrooms</h3>
        <p>
          Place muhsrooms in a bowl and cover with lukewarm water, soak them for
          20 minutes, then drain. Don't discard the soaking water, but get rid
          of sand residue that may be left at the bottom.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>potatoes</h3>
        <p>
          Peel the potatoes and grate them on the smallest / fine grating mesh.
          Squeeze the potato mass through the gaze to separate the liquid, pour
          the liquid into a separate bowl, and set aside for 15 minutes. Pour
          out the liquid carefully (discard it), then add starch residue
          accumulated on the bottom of the bowl to the grated and drained
          potatoes mass.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>dough</h3>
        <p>
          Add the egg, all-purpose flour, potato starch and 1/2 teaspoon of salt
          to the grated potatoes. Mix. The dough should be quite dense at this
          point. Put the dough on a large, flat plate, level it with a spoon.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>cooking dumplings</h3>
        <p>
          Boil a few liters of water in a large pot, add 1 tablespoon of salt.
          Put a few dumplings into boiling water - by pulling the small portion
          of a dough with a wet spoon from the plate directly into the water.
          After 1 minute, gently stir them with wooden spoon. Cook the dumplings
          for about 4 minutes after they float to the surface. If they break up
          while cooking in water, add more flour to the mass and try again.
          Drain the cooked dumplings and place in a bowl.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>frying</h3>
        <p>
          In the meantime, slice the onion. Melt the butter in a frying pan and
          fry the onion slices for 2 minutes. Then add drained mushrooms and 2
          tablespoons of soaking water and stir-fry for 10 minutes on low heat,
          until slightly browned. Season with salt, fresh pepper and bear’s
          garlic. Finally, add the cooked dumplings and fry over medium heat for
          one minute, stirring gently but frequently. Serve immediately.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
